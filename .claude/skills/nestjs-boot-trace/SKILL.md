name: nestjs-boot-trace
description: Use when a NestJS application is slow to start, when the user asks why boot takes so long or which provider or onModuleInit is expensive, or when they mention --timings, boot timings, or the boot trace. Instruments main.ts, captures one real boot, and overlays per-class construction times on the module graph.

# NestJS boot trace

> v0.9.9

A scan reads source files and never runs the application, so construction time
does not exist for it to measure. NestJS records it during a boot. This skill
captures that boot and feeds it back into the report.

It edits the user's `src/main.ts`. Say so before you start, and revert it at
the end unless they ask to keep it.

## 1. Check the version

```bash
npm ls @nestjs/core
```

`@nestjs/core` 9.3.9 or newer records `initTime` for every provider and
controller. Nest 11.1.4 or newer also accepts the `instrument` option, which
times `onModuleInit` and `onApplicationBootstrap` per class. Below 11.1.4, skip
`hookTimings` and `instrument`; class construction times still work.

## 2. Instrument the bootstrap

Add to `src/main.ts`, for development only:

```ts
import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { performance } from "node:perf_hooks";
import { NestFactory, SerializedGraph } from "@nestjs/core";

const hookTimings: { className: string; hook: string; ms: number; startMs: number }[] = [];

const t0 = performance.now();
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, {
  snapshot: true,
  instrument: {
    instanceDecorator(instance: any) {
      if (!instance || typeof instance !== "object") return instance;
      for (const hook of ["onModuleInit", "onApplicationBootstrap"]) {
        const original = instance[hook];
        if (typeof original !== "function") continue;
        try {
          instance[hook] = async function (...args: unknown[]) {
            const start = performance.now();
            try { return await original.apply(this, args); }
            finally { hookTimings.push({ className: this.constructor.name, hook, ms: performance.now() - start, startMs: start - t0 }); }
          };
        } catch {} // frozen instances stay untimed
      }
      return instance;
    },
  },
});
const createMs = performance.now() - t0;
await app.init();
const initMs = performance.now() - t0;
await app.listen(3000);
const startupMs = performance.now() - t0;

const graph = JSON.parse(app.get(SerializedGraph).toString());
Object.assign(graph, { createMs, initMs, startupMs, hookTimings });
writeFileSync("nestjs-doctor-timings.json", JSON.stringify(graph));
```

`snapshot: true` is what makes NestJS record `initTime`. The three
`performance.now()` markers become the lifecycle strip. `instanceDecorator`
replaces a method on every instance in the application, so keep it behind an
environment check or a separate entry point rather than shipping it.

## 3. Boot once, then scan

```bash
npx --prefix server nestjs-doctor server --report --timings nestjs-doctor-timings.json
```

A monorepo boots once per entry point. Instrument each `main.ts`, keep one dump per app, and pass them together, labelled when a name helps: `--timings nestjs-doctor-timings.json,worker=worker-timings.json`. Each dump becomes its own trace in the report.

Relative paths resolve against the scanned directory. Without `--report` the
flag is ignored, with a warning. A missing file, invalid JSON, or a dump
without `initTime` each warn on stderr and still render the report, so check
stderr before trusting an empty trace.

## 4. Read the result

Each class's time includes waiting on its own dependencies. A shared slow
dependency therefore counts again in every class that awaits it.

The init and bootstrap segments split where the first
`onApplicationBootstrap` hook starts; a dump without hook offsets shows one
merged hooks segment.

Read down a cascade until the number drops. The class where it drops owns the
time. Nest clocks each class from its own load start, so the first stretch of
the build phase (the module scan) has no bars, and a controller's bar draws
after its slowest dependency. If `UsersService` reads 120ms and the `SlowService` it injects reads 119ms,
`SlowService` owns it.

A module node shows the build of its slowest class, never a sum across
classes. Its hook time is the total across the module's classes, for example
`104ms build · 63ms init`. A package node keeps its `package` line and shows
its time in the tooltip.

Classes from package modules (`TypeOrmCoreModule`, `BullModule`,
`ConfigHostModule`) sit in their own groups with an `external` tag. The slow
part of a boot is often there: `DataSource` in `TypeOrmCoreModule` is the
database connection, and every repository waits on it. When exactly one
module imports a non-global package module instance, the hover card names
it, which is where `forFeature` or `registerQueue` was called. Global ones
such as `TypeOrmCoreModule` and `ConfigHostModule` never name an importer.

## 5. Put main.ts back

Revert the instrumentation unless the user asked to keep it behind a flag.
